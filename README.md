This repo provides our source code for the [2026 NFL Big Data Bowl](https://www.kaggle.com/c/nfl-big-data-bowl-2026-analytics) where we analyzed how defender 40 time affects pass completion probabilities. 

The final production code is stored in the *Final Code* folder, with additional development code in the *Additional Exploration* folder with some of the other concepts/ideas that we explored.
