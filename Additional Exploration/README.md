This folder contains notebooks of various ideas we had with the data, but decided to not move forward with for this iteration:
  1. The "Combine Analysis" notebook pulls in NFL Combine data and evaluates the WRs 40yd, Vertical, 3Cone, and Shuttle data.
  2. The "Defender Analysis" notebook contains functions and metrics to evaluate defender movement while the ball is in the air, the distances between an offensive player and the nearest defender, and defender angles. The calculations are then pulled together in one final dataframe for evaluation.
  3. The "Offense" notebook's main function was to explore the possibility of a "route classification" function. We explored the possibility of using player coordinates, angles, directions, acceleration, and speed to classify routes in order to identify full route trees. With the classification function in place, this opened up the possibility of evaluating how different route combinations affect defender movement, route completion percentages, defensive coverages, and more.
  4. The "Summarize Metrics" notebook was used to evaluate how influential 40 yard dash times were for defenders.
  5. The "Visualize Acceleration to Ball" notebook analyzed player's acceleration over the course of a play.
  6. The "Visuals" notebook contains the code to generate the animated plays that we used for the vieo as well as to help us visualize plays.
  7. The "WR Analysis" notebook contains metrics that track WRs data.
